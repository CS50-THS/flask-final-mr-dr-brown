# Final Project - Flask

For your final project, you are going to create a Flask app that uses at least one API.

## Verboten
* Using AI to write any part of your code is forbidden and will be treated as academic disonesty
* Editing `.devcontainer.json`, `README.md`, or anything in the `.vscode` folder is forbidden and will be treated as academic disonesty

## Requirements
* At least four HTML templates **in addition to layout.html**
* At least three routes
* At lease one form which is accessible via `GET` with a methd of `POST`
    `<form method="post" `
* If you app supports logging in and/or registering for an account, those forms **DO NOT** meet the requirement above.
* An SQLite3 database of at least one table
* If you app supports logging in and/or registering for an account, your database must store **MORE** than just login information
* Every route makes some API call to the API you are using
* The API you use must be approved by your teacher
* Your forms should use JavaScript to validate input. 
* If your forms are not the kind of forms that require validating data, you must use JavaScript for some other significant function.
* You must make at least two API calls via Python. (you **may** make API calls via JavaScript too, but at least two calls via Python are required)
* If you install any Python modules for your app, you must include the name of said module in your `requirements.txt` file
* You must include in `schema.txt` a query that will `CREATE` all of the tables you need for your app **AND** `INSERT` starter data **IF NEEDED**
* You must include some CSS in your `static/styles.css` file
* **ALL* of your CSS must be in `static/styles.css`
* **ALL* of your JavaScript must be in `static/script.js`
* You **MUST** include comments citing any code snippets or ideas you find online or from a friend or family member

## NOT REQUIRED
* You **MAY, but are NOT REQUIRED** to support logging in
* You **MAY, but are NOT REQUIRED** to set and read cookies
* You **MAY, but are NOT REQUIRED** to use a Python (or JavaScript) "wrapper" for your API which you did not write. Please cite this as you would any other "borrowed" code.

## GROUP PROJECTS
You may work with up to two other students, as long as you meet the following additional requirements:

* You must have your partnership approved by your teacher before 5/8.
* Requirements for CSS, JS, will increase based on the number of students.
* Requirements for the number of routes and templates will increase based on the number of students.
    * TWO PEOPLE - SIX TEMPLATES, FIVE ROUTES
    * THREE PEOPLE - SIX TEMPLATES, SEVEN ROUTES

## GRADING

### Correctness - 40 points
Does your app meet all of the requirements above with no bugs?

### Design - 20 points
* Is your app well-deisgned?

Consider repeated code, unecessary function calls, unusual user interface design, etc. 

### Style - 20 points
Proper indentation, line length, casing, etc. for each language used. 

### Consistent Effort - 20 points
Be sure to work on this - **AND SYNC YOUR WORK** at least every day we meet for class.
